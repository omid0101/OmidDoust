 Backend project
Sprint one: Goal was to build backend mapping objects and examine CRUD on one of them (Class Object in this case, object name:Schoolcls.java in com.entities folder).

Sprint two: Create relationships between tables and test it with CRUD. Sprint two-part one demonstrates tests on class objects and other dependant objects through relational mapping. Sprint two-part two demostrate advanced test on improved programming including all objects.
