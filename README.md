 Backend project related to course: Become a backend expert provided by simplilearn - 2021

1st Sprint: Goal was to build backend mapping objects and examine CRUD on one of them (Class Object in this case, object name:Schoolcls.java in com.entities folder).
MyBackgroundProject-1 and Sprint One folders are related to 1st Sprint.


2nd Sprint: Create relationships between tables and test it with CRUD. Sprint two-part one demonstrates tests on class objects and other dependant objects through 
relational mapping. 
Sprint two-part two demostrate advanced test on improved programming including all objects.
MyBackgroundProject-2, Sprint two-part one and Sprint two-part two folders are related to 2nd Sprint.

There are three 4 objects, accordingly 4 entities for mapping to DB through Hibernate: Class, Teacher, Subject, Student

Relationship between entities defined as following: 
Class- Subject  ---> ManytoMany - ManytoMany
Class- Teacher  ---> ManytoMany - ManytoMany
Class- Student  ---> OnetoMany - ManytoOne


3rd Sprint:Create frond-end pages for setting up master lists for each entity, assigning different objects together described per assignment, and getting entities' reports. 
All was successfully done and reports of screenshot created in the folder. Assigning subject to class, teacher to class to a subject, student to a class.
Reports were generated for each entity (more than assignment requirement).Each single entity was tested inidivually and in combination both in MySQL data base and 
in the reports generated in the fron-end.
MyBackgroundProject-3 and Sprint Three folders are related to 3rd Sprint.
